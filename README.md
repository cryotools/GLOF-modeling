## Three-dimensional simulations of glacial lake outbursts using OpenFOAM
### Introduction
This guideline contains the general workflow used in the accompagnying 
publication in NHESS (citation). With it, the user can employ *OpenFOAM*
to create threedimensional meshes from digital elevation models, delineate
glacial lakes, create breach scenarios and set up simulation runs for 
GLOF events.
