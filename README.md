# 3D CFD Simulations of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods Using OpenFOAM

This document outlines the core elements of the workflow used in **Work Package 3** 
of the project *Future Glacial Lakes in High Mountain Asia – Modeling and Risk Analysis (GLAMoR)*.  
It supports the results presented in:

**Furian and Sauter (2025)**  
*Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences (NHESS)* [citation pending]

## ⚠️ About this Guide

This is not a fully executable, step-by-step script.  
Instead, it provides a structured overview with **code snippets**, **commands**, and **explanatory notes** for key steps involved in:

- Preparing digital elevation data
- Delineating glacial lakes
- Generating 3D meshes
- Defining breach scenarios
- Setting up and running hydrodynamic simulations in OpenFOAM

---

## 🧩 Required Input Data

To apply this workflow, the following input data are required:

- A **digital elevation model (DEM)** with sufficient resolution (e.g., ALOS PALSAR at 12.5 m)
- **Vector outlines** of the glacial lakes (e.g., shapefiles) serving as GLOF origins
- lake bathymetry data (or ice-thickness data for calculating the lake volume)

## 🛠 Software Requirements

The following software stack has been tested and is recommended for running the workflow:

| Software     | Version   | Purpose                                 |
|--------------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| **OpenFOAM** | 2112      | 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation |
| **ParaView** | 5.11.0    | Visualization and postprocessing         |
| **Python**   | 3.8       | Preprocessing and postprocessing scripts |
| **C++**      | —         | Required for OpenFOAM solvers            |

> 💡 *The code is written in both Python and C++.*

### 💻 System Setup and HPC Access

While small test cases may be run locally, **access to a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster** is highly recommended for full-scale simulations. You can use tools like:

- **PuTTY** – for secure SSH terminal access to remote servers
- **WinSCP** – for file transfer between your local machine and the cluster

Make sure that OpenFOAM is correctly installed and configured on the HPC system or simulation server.
