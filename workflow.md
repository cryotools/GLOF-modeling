# 3D CFD Simulations of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods Using OpenFOAM

This document outlines the core elements of the workflow used in **Work Package 3** 
of the project *Future Glacial Lakes in High Mountain Asia ‚Äì Modeling and Risk Analysis (GLAMoR)*.  
It supports the results presented in:

**Furian and Sauter (2025)**  
*Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences (NHESS)* [citation pending]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è About this Guide

This is not a fully executable, step-by-step script.  
Instead, it provides a structured overview with **code snippets**, **commands**, and **explanatory notes** for key steps involved in:

- Preparing digital elevation data
- Delineating glacial lakes
- Generating 3D meshes
- Defining breach scenarios
- Setting up and running hydrodynamic simulations in OpenFOAM

---

## üß© Required Input Data

To apply this workflow, the following input data are required:

- A **digital elevation model (DEM)** with sufficient resolution (e.g., ALOS PALSAR at 12.5‚ÄØm)
- **Vector outlines** of the glacial lakes (e.g., shapefiles) serving as GLOF origins
